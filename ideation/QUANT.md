# QUANT — “Finance Co-Founder” for Creative Venture Studios

## One-liner
An AI finance operator that turns a creative idea into an investor-grade business model: assumptions → unit economics → 3–5 year model → scenarios/sensitivities → capital plan → memo-ready narrative.

---

## The core problem (studio bottleneck)
Creative studios can generate strong concepts and narratives, but the **financials** become a black hole:
- What does it cost to build/launch?
- How does it make money (real revenue streams, not hand-wavy)?
- What are the unit economics?
- How much capital is needed and when?
- When does it break even?
- What does an investor return profile look like?

---

## Product POV
This product acts like a **quant/finance cofounder** for experiential + film/TV + digital media ventures.

**Key principle:** it must produce an *auditable, real model* (Sheets/Excel), not just a chat summary.

---

## Target users
- Celebrity venture studios (internal greenlight + fundraising)
- Producers + development execs
- Brand/experience agencies
- Creator-led startups

---

## Wedge (why this wins)
Generic “startup spreadsheet templates” don’t fit media economics. QUANT wins by:
- Domain-specific templates (touring experiential, FAST, slate/content, membership, shoppable video)
- A benchmark library (ranges + comps) with citations
- “Show your work”: every number traceable to an assumption
- Scenarios + sensitivity tables built-in by default

---

## MVP flow
1) **Idea intake (10–15 min):** guided questionnaire
   - Venture type: experiential / content / digital / hybrid
   - Revenue mix: tickets, sponsorship, ads, licensing/MGs, merch, subs, commerce, fees
   - Costs: fixed vs variable, capex vs opex, marketing, venue, talent, ops
   - Distribution: owned audience vs paid vs platform
   - Timeline + seasonality

2) **Model generation:** produces a spreadsheet + memo
   - Unit economics (per event/city/episode/member)
   - P&L and cashflow (monthly for year 1–2, quarterly thereafter)
   - Scenario sets: base / upside / downside
   - Sensitivities: CAC, churn, fill rate, CPM, utilization, attach rates
   - Capital plan: use of funds, runway, milestones

3) **Investor translation layer:** deck-ready artifacts
   - Business model slide
   - Market sizing + why now framing
   - GTM narrative derived from the model
   - Return math (payback period, MOIC/IRR-style outputs where applicable)

---

## Template modules (future)
- Experiential touring economics (capacity, utilization, ticket tiers, venue rent, staffing, local marketing)
- Content/slate economics (budgets, MGs, backend, distribution windows)
- FAST channel economics (RPM, ad fill, direct-sold vs programmatic, content costs)
- Membership economics (ARPU, churn, CAC, retention curves)
- Shoppable narrative economics (CVR, AOV, take rate, returns)

---

## Moat / defensibility
- Template + benchmark library (domain compounding)
- Trust + audit trail (assumptions, citations, confidence bands)
- Workflow integration (from idea → IC memo → deck → data room)
- Feedback loops: outcomes back into benchmarks

---

## Risks / challenges
- Garbage-in assumptions (needs guardrails + ranges + forced constraints)
- Credibility with sophisticated investors (must be auditable)
- Different venture types require different models (start narrow)

---

## Open questions
1) Internal-only tool vs sellable SaaS?
2) First vertical to nail: experiential touring vs membership vs FAST vs content slate?
3) Primary output: Google Sheets vs Excel?
4) Data sources/benchmarks: what do we trust and how do we cite?

---

## Next step when we un-park
- Choose MVP vertical + output format
- Define the intake schema (fields + required answers)
- Define the spreadsheet model spec (tabs + formulas + scenarios)
- Architecture plan for Claude Code: model builder + benchmark service + export + memo generator
