# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: War Room (Hybrid Mission Control)
# Branch: ralph/war-room-hybrid-mission-control
# Started: 2026-02-02

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript validation (tsc --noEmit)
- Use `npm run lint` for ESLint
- Use `npm run build` for production build verification
- warroom-app/ is the canonical Next.js app directory
- Next.js 16.1.6 with Turbopack, React 19, TypeScript 5

## 2026-02-02 - WR-001
- What was implemented: Verification story - confirmed existing app structure and build hygiene
- Files changed: None (verification only)
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - warroom-app/ is the canonical Next.js app ✓
  - npm run dev works ✓
  - npm run typecheck passes ✓
  - npm run lint passes ✓
  - npm run build passes ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The app uses Next.js 16.1.6 with Turbopack for fast builds
  - Build output shows routes in app/ directory pattern
  - Port 3000 may be in use; dev server auto-selects available port (3001)
  - TypeScript and ESLint are already configured and passing
