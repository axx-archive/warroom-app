# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: War Room (Hybrid Mission Control)
# Branch: ralph/war-room-hybrid-mission-control
# Started: 2026-02-02

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript validation (tsc --noEmit)
- Use `npm run lint` for ESLint
- Use `npm run build` for production build verification
- warroom-app/ is the canonical Next.js app directory
- Next.js 16.1.6 with Turbopack, React 19, TypeScript 5

## 2026-02-02 - WR-001
- What was implemented: Verification story - confirmed existing app structure and build hygiene
- Files changed: None (verification only)
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - warroom-app/ is the canonical Next.js app ✓
  - npm run dev works ✓
  - npm run typecheck passes ✓
  - npm run lint passes ✓
  - npm run build passes ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The app uses Next.js 16.1.6 with Turbopack for fast builds
  - Build output shows routes in app/ directory pattern
  - Port 3000 may be in use; dev server auto-selects available port (3001)
  - TypeScript and ESLint are already configured and passing

## 2026-02-02 - WR-002
- What was implemented: Node/bin-link reliability via version pinning
- Files changed:
  - .nvmrc (new) - pins Node version 25
  - package.json - added engines field requiring Node >=20
  - package-lock.json (regenerated)
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Fresh npm install works ✓
  - npm run typecheck passes ✓
  - npm run lint passes ✓
  - npm run build passes ✓
  - .nvmrc exists ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Node 25.4.0 is the current version used in this environment
  - npm 11.7.0 is the current version
  - The engines field in package.json provides additional enforcement
  - .nvmrc uses just the major version (25) for flexibility

## 2026-02-02 - WR-003
- What was implemented: Added missing gitignore entries for dist/ and logs
- Files changed:
  - .gitignore - added /dist and /logs + *.log patterns
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - .gitignore includes .next/ ✓ (was already present)
  - .gitignore includes node_modules/ ✓ (was already present)
  - .gitignore includes dist/ ✓ (added)
  - .gitignore includes logs ✓ (added)
  - No tracked .next/ or node_modules/ files in repo ✓
  - Typecheck passes ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The default Next.js .gitignore template includes most common patterns already
  - Use `git ls-files --cached | grep` to check for accidentally tracked files
  - Adding *.log catches individual log files anywhere in the tree
