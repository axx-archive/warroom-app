## Overnight Build Session Started (~1:30 AM PT)

AJ gave me co-founder responsibilities on HORIZON. Mission: wake him up impressed.

### What I'm Doing
- Launched Claude Code (session: `grand-ridge`) on ~/Desktop/InsideOut
- Full autonomous mission with:
  1. IA rethink (consolidate 9 tabs → cleaner structure)
  2. AAA visual polish (Block/Cash App inspired)
  3. Mobile responsiveness
  4. Component cleanup
  5. Notifications polish

### Key Context
- **Product**: Relationship intelligence for celebrity IP venture studio
- **Users**: Team (not just AJ) — collaboration features matter
- **Design**: Premium fintech meets creative studio
- **Live**: horizon-vc.vercel.app
- **Repo**: github.com/axx-archive/HORIZON

### Claude Code Status
- Started: ~1:30 AM
- Mode: --dangerously-skip-permissions (autonomous)
- Currently: Exploring codebase structure

Will update this file with progress...

## AJ's Guidance (before bed)

"I want a AAA visual design that's cohesive, stunning, minimal/modern but really really cool and well done."

"I think we need to both evolve all of the stuff that's in there now to be as useful/intuitive and well laid out as possible and then re-think each tab to ensure it's doing everything the best it can"

"Should they all be on one relationships tab with sub-tabs on that tab? or different tabs? how does the relationship health stuff get tracked?"

This is our first real building session together. Let's make it count.
