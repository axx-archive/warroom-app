## RALPH Loop - Horizon v2 Complete 🎉

**All 27 tasks finished** at 5:48 PM PT

### What Got Built
- Network page with unified filters (role pills, warmth, sort)
- Package assembly system (RoleSlots, AssemblyBoard)
- Dashboard widgets (AttentionQueue, PipelineHealth, ActivePackages, AIInsights)
- Scout enhancements (Ask/Research/Draft/Analyze modes, warm path visualization)
- Polish (sidebar nav, keyboard shortcuts `G D`/`G N`/`G P`/`G S`/`?`, Block-inspired styling)
- Projects → Packages rename throughout

### Issue During Loop
Commit detection bug caused iterations 17-25 to spin on task 4.4 (AIInsightsWidget) even though it was done. Had to manually fix prd.json and restart. Loop finished successfully after fix.

## QA Review Findings

Did full browser testing (desktop + mobile) with AJ's test credentials.

### Critical Issue
**Sidebar nav invisible on desktop** - Only "Command" shows, other nav items (Packages, Network, Scout) are in DOM but text is invisible. CSS bug - text color likely matching background.

### Medium Issues
- Sort dropdown truncated "Last Conta..." on Network
- Kanban doesn't work on mobile (columns cut off) - should default to List view
- Floating Scout button shows even on /scout page (redundant)

### What Looks Great
- Assembly Board is the star - intuitive, beautiful
- Mobile responsive generally solid
- Scout interface clean
- Visual design polished
- Gold accent branding works well

**Waiting on:** AJ's go-ahead to fix sidebar CSS issue
