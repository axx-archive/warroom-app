# 2026-02-01 — Horizon UX / Design Upgrade Task List

If you ask: **“what's on our list for today?”** → this file is the canonical answer.

## Today’s goals
1. **Research (web + X)**: collect references for best-in-class dashboard UX + "command center" aesthetics, with an emphasis on Block-family design sensibilities. ✅
2. **Structured UX walkthrough of Horizon**: Command → Packages → Network → Scout. ✅ (captures taken)
3. Deliverables:
   - **Punch list** (10–20 prioritized changes) ✅ (see below)
   - **Visual direction brief** (tokens + components) ✅ (see below)
   - **1–2 prototype-level components** ✅ (Status Strip + Command Brief shipped; DataTable++ next)

## Current plan (rest of today)
1. Implement **DataTable++ foundation** (TanStack Table + shadcn)
2. Migrate **Network** to DataTable++ (first proving ground)
3. Add **Packages “List”** view using DataTable++
4. Convert **Command → Active Packages** section to table-first (optional toggle back to cards)

---

## Punch list (prioritized)

### App-wide (unlock everything)
1) Flip default theme to **dark** everywhere (light optional).
2) Enforce surface taxonomy: **Table View (operate)** / **Context Drawer (inspect)** / **Focus Modal (commit)**.
3) Normalize page header anatomy: Title + 1-line focus + primary CTA + secondary actions.
4) Use gold as a **brand marker**, not full theming (focus/selected/active pips).
5) Build a shared **DataTable++** foundation (density, hover actions, selection bar, column controls, saved views).

### Command
6) Replace equal-weight card grid with: **Status Strip** + **Command Brief hero**.
7) Make **Active Packages** table-first; cards as optional view toggle.
8) Add **mini Assembly previews** as signature visual.
9) Make empty states actionable (AI insights / attention).

### Packages
10) Make **List** the primary operational view (DataTable++); Board becomes secondary/visual.
11) Add package **Context Drawer** + multi-step **Focus Modal** for create/assembly.

### Network
12) Upgrade table for density + hierarchy + actions (DataTable++).
13) Convert tabs into **saved views** presets.

### Scout
14) Move from centered landing to tool surface: outputs as panels/cards; keyboard-first.
15) Scout becomes global command plane (Cmd+K groups + shortcuts).

## Visual direction brief (aligned w/ DESIGN-SYSTEM)
**Direction:** calm black canvas + sharp signals (Linear/Raycast restraint with Block/Cash App moments).

- Most UI: black/white opacity ramps (calm, readable at density)
- Horizon gold: sparse marker (focus rings, selected row, active indicator)
- State colors: hot/warm/success reserved for urgency
- Typography rules matter more than font swaps: tabular numerals, strict alignment (left text / right numbers)

---

## Prototypes

### Shipped (commit `a8ba61e` on branch `design/command-center-prototypes`)
- Dark-default shell (forced `html.dark`, background + grain)
- **Status Strip** component
- **Command Brief** component
- Command page updated to use both
- Small density + sticky header improvements on Network table (not full DataTable++ yet)

### Next
- **DataTable++ foundation** using TanStack Table (+ optional virtualization)
- Migrate Network → Packages List → Command Active Packages

## Research links + notes

### Block / Cash App / Block-family sensibilities
- Block media kit (logos + usage guidelines zip)
  - https://block.xyz/mediakit
  - Notes: Block’s modern identity leans on a simple geometric core (the cube) + strong contrast; useful to justify a restrained UI palette with a single “brand bar” accent.
- Block brand / identity breakdown (good for rationale language)
  - https://thehardcopy.co/branding-lessons-from-blocks-launch/
  - Notes: reinforces the idea of “one distinctive signature” (gradient/shape) vs. lots of decorative UI.
- Cash App engineering philosophy relevant to design-systems-as-schema (design → code invariants)
  - https://code.cash.app/native-ui-and-multiplatform-compose-with-redwood
  - Notes: treat your component set as a *schema*; generate consistent widgets across surfaces; incremental adoption mindset.
