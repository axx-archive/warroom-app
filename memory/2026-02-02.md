## Ralph loops — updated workflow decision

We’re **not doing Manual Ralph** as the default anymore.

New operating mode:
- **Axx (me) sets up the loop**: create the PRD, convert to Ralph `tasks/prd.json`, and make sure the workstream is ready (branch name, stories right-sized, archive old `tasks/prd.json` if needed).
- **AJ initiates the run in Claude Code** (so auth/UI focus is handled by the human).
- **After the loop run finishes**, AJ asks Axx to **review the codebase for sloppiness / tech debt** and propose cleanup PRs/tasks.

Manual Ralph remains a last-resort fallback only if the loop runner is repeatedly unstable or bookkeeping can’t be trusted.
