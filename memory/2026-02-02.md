## Manual Ralph ("I run the show") workflow — learning

Ralph shell loops + Claude Code sessions were getting SIGKILL (signal 9), which can interrupt the bookkeeping step that flips `passes: true` in `tasks/prd.json` even after the code is committed.

To make progress resilient, switch to **Manual Ralph**:

Per story (US-XXX) where `passes:false`:
1. Pick next story in dependency order (not necessarily PRD order).
2. Implement the story (use Claude Code as a tool if helpful, but keep runs short).
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit`.
4. Commit with a clear message.
5. Immediately update:
   - `tasks/prd.json` → set `passes:true` for that story
   - `tasks/progress.txt` → append a short completion note
   - commit the bookkeeping update

Benefits:
- Eliminates long-running loop brittleness.
- Prevents rework from "committed but not marked complete" drift.
- If SIGKILL happens mid-story, only that story is affected; state stays consistent.

Notes:
- Keep `tasks/prd.json` and `git log` in sync by periodically verifying the next `passes:false` story matches actual commits.
