## Ralph loops — updated workflow decision

We’re **not doing Manual Ralph** as the default anymore.

New operating mode:
- **Axx (me) sets it up**: create the PRD, convert to Ralph `tasks/prd.json`, and make sure the workstream is ready (branch name, stories right-sized, archive old `tasks/prd.json` if needed).
- **AJ initiates the run in Claude Code** (so auth/UI focus is handled by the human).
- **After the loop run finishes**, AJ asks Axx to **review the codebase for sloppiness / tech debt** and propose cleanup PRs/tasks.

Manual Ralph remains a last-resort fallback only if the loop runner is repeatedly unstable or bookkeeping can’t be trusted.

## Horizon daily QA agent (planned)

AJ wants a **daily 4:00 AM PT** automated “act like a user” run against `horizon-vc.vercel.app` to catch regressions in core CRM/package flows (create project/package, add/attach Talent/Investors/Partners, move statuses, comment, etc.).

Security note: credentials were shared in chat; **do not store them in workspace/repo**. Prefer 1Password (`op`) runtime fetch or rotate to a dedicated test account + env vars.

Open questions to confirm with AJ before implementation:
- prod-only vs add staging
- reporting: GitHub Issues vs daily report message/log only
- secrets: confirm 1Password setup
