- Bullseye Scout runs still failing intermittently with `Claude Code process exited with code 1`.
- Noted OpenClaw exec sessions being SIGKILL’d (signal 9):
  - `quick-sa` killed; terminal printed: `Update available! Run: brew upgrade claude-code`
  - `gentle-c` killed; logs show Scout query error surfaced as `Claude Code process exited with code 1`.
- Likely interplay: Anthropic overload (529) + fragile execution/retry + process termination; needs reliability patches (retry/backoff, concurrency caps, better error classification).
- Another SIGKILL (signal 9) observed: exec session `sharp-mi` killed during Scout run; Bullseye returned 200 but emitted SSE `result` then `error` with `Claude Code process exited with code 1` after ~33s.
