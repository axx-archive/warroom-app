## Claude Code on X — deeper pull (actionable signals + links)

Goal: extract concrete posts/threads about **worktrees / parallel sessions**, **plan mode + fresh context**, **CLAUDE.md conventions**, and **context hygiene (/context, /compact)**, plus **hooks**.

### High-signal posts captured (direct URLs)

#### Worktrees / parallel sessions / multi-agent ops
1) Suguru (JP) — “run lots of agents” patterns: Task/sub-agent method + tmux + git worktree isolation.
   - URL: https://x.com/SuguruKun_ai/status/2012442270860243215
   - Claim: 
     - Method A: use sub-agents / task tool, run ~10 concurrently, then batch/queue.
     - Method B: tmux + multiple CLI sessions + **git worktree per session** + role separation (engineer/PM/etc).
   - Actionable: reinforces our existing default: **tmux for stability + worktrees for isolation** when running parallel workstreams.

2) sora19ai (JP) — recommends a “claude-code-tips (40+ tips)” resource; explicitly mentions git worktree as covered.
   - URL: https://x.com/sora19ai/status/2008297577804857561
   - Actionable: there exists a community “tips compendium” worth skimming later for any missing best practices; not yet captured because X post doesn’t expose the external link cleanly in DOM.

#### Plan mode / plan-first loops (plus cross-model verification)
3) Boris Cherny — **when you accept a plan, Claude Code can auto-clear context** for a fresh window to improve adherence.
   - URL: https://x.com/bcherny/status/2012663636465254662
   - Claim: auto-clearing context on plan acceptance keeps Claude on-track longer; option to disable.
   - Actionable: validates our “plan → fresh context implementation” contract as *first-class*.

4) Matt Pocock — practical loop for overwhelmed devs:
   - URL: https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/2018085282743284004
   - Loop:
     1) start plan mode
     2) plan a small feature
     3) once happy, auto-accept edits
     4) pause if unhappy
     5) **clear context and repeat** for next feature
   - Actionable: aligns tightly with Ralph-style story sizing. Suggest we explicitly recommend “feature granularity small enough to execute in one fresh context window.”

5) Alex Finn — “two-agent adversarial loop”: Claude Code plan mode, validate plan in Codex, cross-review changes.
   - URL: https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2012653446349131953
   - Actionable: fits as an optional “power-up”: use a second model as reviewer/critic when stakes are high; matches our hybrid approach.

#### CLAUDE.md (repo-local operating instructions)
6) MB (MihaiButnaru) — CLAUDE.md contents guidance:
   - URL: https://x.com/MihaiButnaru/status/2015393470219727048
   - Suggested content: project structure, conventions, tech stack details, common patterns.
   - Actionable: supports our existing posture: keep CLAUDE.md concise, high-signal, and project-specific.

7) Tech Bro — generic “5 steps” incl. encode rules in CLAUDE.md; low engagement.
   - URL: https://x.com/tech_broo_/status/2018246482642788645
   - Actionable: mostly confirms the meme; not much new.

#### Context tools / /context / /compact
8) Ian Nuttall — **/context command** shows context window/token usage and shows MCP use + CLAUDE.md memory files.
   - URL: https://x.com/iannuttall/status/1958438361993007568
   - Actionable: add to docs as a troubleshooting aid (“if things get weird, run /context; watch for auto-compact and tool bloat”).

9) Dax — bug report: typing /context can select /compact; hitting Enter might compact immediately.
   - URL: https://x.com/daxhns/status/2013586240889618733
   - Actionable: warn to be careful with command palette selection; don’t spam-enter after “/con…”

#### Hooks (notifications / guardrails)
10) David Toth — hooks used to ping for required input; multi-session steering via secure relay.
   - URL: https://x.com/dvdtoth/status/2018413620040798626
   - Actionable: hooks are useful as “human-in-the-loop” notifications and control flow (not just tests). Reinforces: hooks for **enforcement + alerting**.

### Notes on lower-signal / unverified command lists
- Umesh__digital posts a list of “slash commands” (/agents /mcp /hooks /sandbox) + keyboard shortcuts.
  - URL: https://x.com/Umesh__digital/status/2016792236214931885
  - This reads like marketing/aggregation; commands/shortcuts should be treated as **unverified** until confirmed by actual Claude Code UX/docs.

## Claude Code system updates (agents/skills/docs)

Changes made under `/Users/ajhart/.claude/`:
- Added commit-enabled skill: `.claude/skills/techdebt/SKILL.md` (tech debt sweep; edits + verify + commit with explicit approval checkpoint).
- Added agent wrappers:
  - `.claude/agents/doc-updater.md` — doc-only updates, doc-only commits with approval.
  - `.claude/agents/staff-engineer-reviewer.md` — plan/diff critic role (edge cases, sequencing, verification discipline).
- Updated orchestrators/specialists to include “system hygiene” notes (plan→fresh context, CLAUDE.md self-improving loop, optional techdebt).
- Updated `.claude/agents/pm.md` so PM routes to:
  - `@doc-updater` agent
  - `@staff-engineer-reviewer` agent
  - `techdebt` skill
  and documents a canonical skill invocation pattern.

Docs alignment:
- Patched Axxon Labs docs to mention terminal UX (`@agent`, `/command`) while emphasizing filesystem truth (`.claude/agents/*`, `.claude/skills/*`) and a portable invocation format.

Note: `.claude` is not a git repo, so these edits are not committed anywhere by default.

## War Room / Mission Control product plan
Wrote a working product plan doc for the “War Room” local webapp concept:
- /Users/ajhart/.openclaw/workspace/docs/WAR_ROOM_PRD.md

Core idea:
- War Room UI asks `@pm` to generate agent chain + run packets.
- War Room app creates worktrees + opens Cursor windows (preferred) per agent lane.
- Packets are staged as `WARROOM_PACKET.md` in each worktree; manual copy/paste is MVP; autopaste later.
- System truth is file-backed (tasks/prd.json + progress.txt + .claude/agents + .claude/skills + git).

## X thread: “Mission Control / AI agent squad” (pbteja1998)
Thread: https://x.com/pbteja1998/status/2017662163540971756

High-signal takeaway (relevant to AJ’s War Room concept):
- The thread’s core thesis is the same motivation: **continuity + team-like coordination**, not “single chat assistant.”
- The proposed architecture is essentially **multiple persistent sessions/agents + a control plane UI**, with shared context living in a workspace.
- While this thread is about Clawdbot/OpenClaw (not Claude Code), the transferable pattern is: you don’t need a magical API to get a “team feel”—you need **isolated sessions + shared external state + orchestration UI**.

Action: keep as reference/inspiration when refining `docs/WAR_ROOM_PRD.md` (especially the control-plane framing).

Captured tips (visible in-thread):
1) **Do more in parallel**
   - “Spin up 3–5 git worktrees at once, each running its own Claude session in parallel.”
   - Notes: Boris personally uses multiple git checkouts; team prefers worktrees.

2) **Start every complex task in plan mode**
   - “Pour energy into the plan so Claude can 1-shot implementation.”
   - Team pattern: one Claude writes the plan; a second Claude reviews it like a staff engineer.
   - (Text cuts off mid-sentence on-page, but core pattern is clear: plan-first + immediate escalation when things go sideways.)

3) **Invest in CLAUDE.md**
   - After every correction, explicitly ask: “Update your CLAUDE.md so you don’t make that mistake again.”
   - “Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself.”
   - Iterate ruthlessly over time.

4) **Create your own skills and commit them to git; reuse across projects**
   - Heuristic: “If you do something more than once a day, turn it into a skill or command.”
   - Suggestion: build a **/techdebt** slash command and run it at end of each session to find & kill duplication.

5) **Claude fixes most bugs by itself**
   - Team workflow: enable **Slack MCP**, paste a Slack bug thread, say “fix.”
   - Or “Go fix the failing CI tests” (don’t micromanage).
   - Point Claude at docker logs to diagnose.

6) **Level up your prompting**
   - “Challenge Claude”: e.g. “Grill me on these changes and don’t make a PR until I pass your test.”
   - “Prove to me this works” and have Claude **diff behavior between main and feature branch**.

Actionables to potentially integrate into our system docs:
- Make “**plan + staff-engineer review**” the standard ‘power-up’ reviewer role when stakes are high.
- Add a system rule: after a correction, force the agent to propose a small CLAUDE.md update (so mistakes don’t recur).
- Add a “**tech debt sweep**” ritual (either as a command or checklist) to reduce duplication over time.
- Add a “bug fix loop”: give failing CI output/logs; ask for end-to-end fix; require verification and minimal diff.

## What’s actionable for AJ’s evolved system (candidate doc adds)

### A) Make “Plan acceptance → fresh context” a *formal contract*
- Cite bcherny post: plan acceptance auto-clears context (optionally).
- Convert into a rule-of-thumb:
  - “Plan a *single* story/feature; accept plan; let the tool reset context; then execute only that plan; verify; commit; repeat.”

### B) Worktrees as the default for parallelism
- Explicit pattern:
  - One worktree per workstream (and/or per agent role).
  - tmux panes per worktree for stable long runs.
  - Avoids branch collisions, context bleed.

### C) Context hygiene instrumentation
- Add /context usage as a standard debugging move.
- Add a caution note re /compact selection bug.

### D) Hooks as guardrails + notifications
- Hooks not only for “run tests” but also for “ping human when input needed” and “stop-the-line on failed verification.”

### E) Optional “two-model critic” power-up
- Not default, but recommended when doing large refactors or high-stakes changes:
  - CC plans/implements; second model reviews and tries to break the plan or find missing edge cases.

## Next steps
- If we decide to evolve Axxon Labs docs again: these should become small, crisp additions (no bloat). 
- If AJ wants, we can patch:
  - AXXON_LABS_SYSTEM_MANUAL.md: add a short subsection under “Solo founder speed defaults” about **plan acceptance clearing context** + /context.
  - AXXON_LABS_QUICKGUIDE.md: add “/context” + “worktrees+tmux” bullet + “hooks for notifications.”
