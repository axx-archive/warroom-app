  "pmPrompt": "# War Room Merge Choreography\n\n## Run: bullseye-audit\n**Goal:** Comprehensive reliability, execution resilience, and UX overhaul for Bullseye based on full audit assessment. Fix transient-provider fragility (529/429 errors), implement proper rate limiting, add retry/backoff, improve SSE resilience, and enhance UX with proper error states and partial results handling.\n**Integration Branch:** warroom/integration/bullseye-audit\n\n## Merge Order\n1. lane-1-review (warroom/bullseye-audit/staff-review) - squash - 0 commits\n2. lane-2-reliability (warroom/bullseye-audit/reliability) - squash - 0 commits\n3. lane-3-sse (warroom/bullseye-audit/sse-resilience) - squash - 0 commits\n4. lane-4-ux (warroom/bullseye-audit/ux-improvements) - squash - 0 commits\n5. lane-5-qa (warroom/bullseye-audit/qa-verification) - squash - 0 commits\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Review each lane's changes before merging\n2. Merge lanes in the proposed order\n3. If conflicts occur, resolve them before continuing\n4. Run tests after each merge\n5. After all lanes merged, verify the integration branch\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n```bash\n# Check out integration branch\ngit checkout warroom/integration/bullseye-audit\n\n# Merge a lane (replace BRANCH with actual branch name)\ngit merge --no-ff BRANCH -m \"Merge LANE_ID into integration\"\n\n# Or squash merge\ngit merge --squash BRANCH && git commit -m \"Merge LANE_ID: description\"\n```\n\n---\nGenerated by War Room"
